 Secure Portfolio Website Deployment
This project demonstrates how to securely deploy and manage a personal portfolio website on a virtual machine running Ubuntu. It was developed as part of my cybersecurity diploma to explore secure web hosting, Linux administration, and common attack simulations in a real-world environment.

üìå Project Overview
The project includes:

-Hosting a PHP-based portfolio website with login and blog functionality
-Configuring secure access with role-based access control (RBAC)
-Securing the server using iptables firewall rules
-Monitoring the server with Zabbix
-Simulating common web attacks (SQL Injection & Forced Browsing)
-Ensuring secure access across virtual machines

üß± Technologies Used
-LAMP Stack: Apache, MySQL, PHP
-phpMyAdmin for DB management
-Zabbix for monitoring
-iptables for firewall configuration
-Ubuntu 22.04 server environment
-VirtualBox for VM testing

üîß Features Implemented
‚úÖ 1. Secure Web Server Setup
Installed Apache, MySQL, PHP, and phpMyAdmin
Proper file permissions and ownership
Website served from /var/www/html
‚úÖ 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
PHP-based authentication with MySQL backend
Redirects based on user roles (admin/user)
‚úÖ 3. Firewall Configuration (iptables)
Only allowed essential ports: HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and SSH (22)
Restricted SSH access to a single trusted IP
‚úÖ 4. Server Monitoring (Zabbix)
Zabbix agent installed on the web server
Monitoring for HTTP response, CPU, RAM, and disk usage
Email alerts configured for critical events
‚úÖ 5. Security Testing
SQL Injection: Mitigated via prepared statements
Forced Browsing: Blocked using session-based access control
‚úÖ 6. External Access Test
Website successfully accessed from another VM within the network

üõ°Ô∏è Key Takeaways
Gained hands-on experience in secure website deployment
Applied Linux system administration and firewall best practices
Validated security through real-world attack simulations
Implemented effective monitoring and alerting for availability and resource usage
